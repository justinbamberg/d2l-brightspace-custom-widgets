# Getting Started Faculty Widget
Custom widget used on the course homepage for faculty as a guide to start the new semester.  
<br>
This widget is turned on and off after the first of each semester so it doesn't continue to clutter the faculty course homepage. 
<br>
 Set the widget to be visible to Admins and Faculty.
 <br>
 You will need to update the html code to add your own images and links to help documentation. <br><br>
